## Kabyle Arrow Words

This web application offers to play arrow words in Kabyle language. You can play at [this page](https://nabil509.github.io/kab-arrow-words/). This application is based on React JS library.

### How to play?

Click on empty cells to enter letters. You can move through cells with keyboard direction keys and delete letters with "←" and "Delete" keys. You can use these shortcuts to enter Kabyle special characters: e_ = ɛ | c_ = č | d_ = ḍ | g_ = ǧ | h_ = ḥ | q_ = ɣ | r_ = ṛ | s_ = ṣ | z_ = ẓ. Try to fill the grid in a record time!
